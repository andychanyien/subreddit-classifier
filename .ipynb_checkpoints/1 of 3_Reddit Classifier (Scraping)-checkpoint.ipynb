    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Some people wish they were born with super powers, allowing them to do many amazing things typical human beings could not do. On the other hand, there are also some super powers which could bring some inconvenience too. For example, the ability to turn things into gold by touching an object (like the midas touch) may seem like an awesome super power. However, it also turns food into gold; you will not be unable to eat anything at all. In such cases, people would call it a \"shitty super power\". The subreddit dedicated for such discussion is r/shittysuperpowers. The super powers discussion are usually hilarious power which affects daily lives and daily activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more extreme version and positive version can be found here r/godtiersuperpower. According to the description, it is \"r/shittysuperpowers, but they're actually god tier\". In this subreddit, they discuss hilarious powers but gives strong powers that are comparable to God. Hence, both subreddit have hilarious powers but the difference lies with the outcome of those super powers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In which subreddit would your super power be classified under? The aim of this notebook is to build a classifier model based on reddit users' sentiments. The classifier would be able to determine whether a super power is \"god-tier\" [1] or \"shitty\" [0] through analysing the text within the post. Since the training dataset would be from reddit users, if the model has high accuracy and predictability, it should be able to determine what reddit users think about your super power. The classfier models which will be explored are Logistic Regression, Multinomial NB and RandomForest, vectorised either by Count or by TFIDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Measurement of Success**\n",
    "\n",
    "The prediction of the model will be scored and it's accuracy will be determined. The higher the accuracy, the more accurate the model is at predicting whether a super power is considered god-tier or shitty, based on Redditors' sentiment/opinions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another measurement of success will be feeding the model two super powers and determine if the predictions are likely to be true.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primary Stakeholders**\n",
    "\n",
    "The model could be useful content creators, such as novel writers or comic creators, to determine whether their new super hero with a new super power would be favourable among the community or not. In the world of content creators, these are valuable information which allows them to sense whether their idea would be favourable or not within the community. Furthermore, when vying for consumers' attention, creators with a headstart have a higher chance extending their lead in the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Secondary Stakeholders**\n",
    "\n",
    "Another useful application would be using it as a tool for reddit's website backend. The subreddit moderators could use such tools to automatically classify posts which may not belong to a certain subreddit group."

    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Reddit is a go-to place for communities to engage in discussions and express themselves in across various topics in different subreddits. Wouldn't it be nice to know how the community feels about certain issues without looking through thousands of posts? Wouldn't we then be able to know what grabs their attention?\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on two subreddits, r/godtiersuperpowers and r/shittysuperpowers, a model was developed to determine whether a post belongs to which subreddit. The model was trained based on redditors' sentiments and opinions in both subreddits. Through such a model, we could understand whether a super power would be considered \"God-tier\" or \"Shitty\".\n",
    "\n",
    "During the EDA, the words used in each subreddit was analysed based on frequency (using Count Vectorisation) and its salience (using TFIDF Vectorisation). Firstly, the 20 most frequent words were compared between the two subreddits to see what kind of words appear the most in each subreddit. The more certain words appear over the other subreddit, the stronger it is as a determinant in the classifier model. Secondly, the TFIDF Vectorisor showed the most significant (or unique) word in each posts, relative to the all the text. The more unique the word, the stronger it is as a determinant in the classifier model. Finally, salient words in each subreddit were also compared against each other to determine the words unique to each subreddit and whether there were common words.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Findings**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The median word count for r/godtiersuperpowers and r/shittysuperpowers are 56 words and 46 words respectively, with many outliers writing beyond 500 words.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Both subreddits have quite a lot in common\n",
    "    - Among the 20 most frequent words, there were 10 common words.\n",
    "    - There about 700 words unique to each subreddit, with 166 common words.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The common words tend to describe god-tier powers more, making it likely for model to predict false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Context is still very important, words without context are insufficient to qualify a super power.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Evaluation and Selection**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Count Vectorisation and TFIDF Vectorisation to preprocess the dataset, and applying it to Logisitic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes and RandomForest, a total of 6 models were developed. The models were also optimised by tuning their hyperparameters using GridSearchCV and RandomSearchCV. Out of the 6 models, the top 2 performing models were scored based on Accuracy and AUC score. In the end, RandomForest with Count Vectorisation performed the best, with the least overfitting, high accuracy and higher AUC score. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Results**\n",
    "\n",
    "One can understand whether a super power would be god-tier or shitty based on the model. It has an accuracy of about 65% with an AUC score of 0.649. Content creators and reddit moderators would be able to leverage on such algorithm but its limitation should be overcome in order for it to be practical and useful.\n",
